# Locomotion Simulation of Fruit Fly Larvae Using Random Walk 

## Project Overview

This simulation is designed to model the random walk of fruit fly, or *Drosophila*, larvae. This simulates a user-determined number of larvae wandering around on a 2-D surface without any external stimuli. 

## Installation

To run the larva simulation, you'll need to have Python installed on your system. Follow the steps below to set up the project:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/larva-simulation.git
   cd larva-simulation
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment:**

- Using `venv` (Unix/macOS):
  ```
  python3 -m venv venv
  source venv/bin/activate
  ```

- Using `virtualenv` (Windows):
  ```
  virtualenv venv
  .\venv\Scripts\activate
  ```

3. **Install dependencies:**
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```


## Usage

To start the simulation, run the following command:

   ```
   python multi_simulator.py
   ```
